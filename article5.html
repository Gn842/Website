    <h1>IDE's and Compilers</h1>
    <h2>What is an IDE?</h2>
    <p>An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software tool that helps programmers write, test, and debug their code more efficiently. It combines features like a code editor, compiler, and debugger in one place, making it easier to develop software. Think of it as a one-stop shop for all your coding needs.</p>
    <h2>What is a Compiler?</h2>
    <p>A compiler is a tool in programming that translates code written in a high-level language, like Java or C++, into machine code that a computer can understand and execute. It helps turn your human-readable code into something the computer can run.</p>
    <h2>How are they related?</h2>
    <p>IDEs and compilers are connected. An IDE often includes a built-in compiler to help you write and test your code in one place. When you write code in an IDE, the integrated compiler translates that code into machine code so your computer can run it, making the development process smoother and more convenient.</p>
