    <h1>What are Frameworks?</h1>
    <p>In programming, frameworks are like pre-built sets of tools and guidelines that help developers create software more efficiently. They provide a foundation with common features already set up, so you donâ€™t have to start from scratch every time. Think of it as a blueprint that speeds up the building process while ensuring consistency and quality.</p>
    <p>Below you can find three examples of a framework in Java:</p>
    <h2>Spring</h2>

    <h2>Hibernate</h2>

    <h2>Apache Struts</h2>
