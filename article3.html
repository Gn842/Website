    <h1>What are Libraries?</h1>
    <p>A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks, like handling data or creating user interfaces, without writing everything from scratch. It helps save time and effort by providing reusable functions and tools.</p>
    <h2>Math</h2>
